  <h3 align="center">A component library to learn new things</h3>
</p>

There are many things to learn. During my advent of code in 2023, I started with some things like this component library I want to further pursue. Part of the plan is to do many things for the first time.
* Playing around the newly released StyleX,
* using a mono repo,
* setting up GitHub actions,
* learning about accessibility
* [using new HTML tags even if Firefox does not like them yet](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/exclusive-accordion?hl=de#the_exclusive_accordion)
* ...

This is my place to learn all of this.
